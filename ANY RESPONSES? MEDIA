Alright, fellow or miss. This is your first mission.

If there were no money, what a community cares about they would maintain, utilizing existing frontages (so it "retrofits" in what you already know), and what was not maintained was probably over-developed or not meant to be - local flavors would develop. Freedom of movement would be incredible, free apartments, free travel etc, but yeah, you would find somewhere you fit in.

Looking for a way to go? Try out Ed Che's new website, developed in order to facilitate and give the idea of a different system that valued volunteering, support and ideas, creativity, and mutual aid to put together new things. Got bills? An L3C will be forming in Detroit in order to supply the things that you need. 

Let's roll it:
Capitalism still around getting you down? Here's an effort that the media will be interested in- how about a Natural Law case against capitalism? Using the violations of history as their examples, and arguing that systemic incentives of a money system are guilty of perpetrating , not only the ruthless destruction of nature, people, forests, and animals, but dividing people in a deep and conspiratorial mind-control.

While a perception's of living in a dark house, when the light of consciousness comes we will build out this system to be cool; neat and high-tech even. An institute-based system could provide everything even for big cities. The limitations will work out in common sense based on what the thing is. I have a fantastic picture of how this would go too. Let's do this.

We are free, let's get free, if you want to write up an article on an angle of this content, let me know. :D
