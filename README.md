Windows build for transition for MS-style square employees

Recently MS announced that they will be giving away access to some of their windows 10 software. Now, in the free software movement world this is no new thing or surprise, but for Microsoft, one of the second-largest corporation in the world, we gotta support them and think about how a corporation can be retrofit included.

Enjoy the build, made from a Windows 7 that I hard-installed on my computer. If this is your niche, then it is; contribute and I will accept the pull requests at the end of the day.
